All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:My resize method and its helper. I thought the helper method made this code more readable. However, since it takes a lot of parameters and has a complicated structure, it does not play an important role as "helper" function in terms of readability.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:There is a better way to divide cases. 

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:I would use less if statements.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:It is easier to follow this code than to follow my ArrayDeque. Coherent structure.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I would like to get more detailed feedback from TA or lab assistants.
